A project that uses an LLM(chatGPT) to build a knowledge graph of hot social media topics.
These relations are scraped and stored in a graph database, like below.

Would like to find more search patterns to better build the knowledge graph.
Ideas include 
1. scoring the connections based on how related the LLM thinks topics are.
2. integrating Youtube view data either as graph coloring or for smarter search
